		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> I am someone who is passionate about Electronics and IT and it has been the driving
			force through out my career. I started my career in  a small tech shop where I worked as a  Voluntary
			Computer Repairer. I worked there for about two years and someone recommended me to a school  and now I worked there as an IT Lab Instructor. In my current role as an IT Lab Instructor, I noticed that the school  had malfunctioning computers and so with my hardware skills from my previous role , I was able to help the school troubleshoot and fix those computers. 
			Also I noticed that , there was no activity which engages the kids in the computer lab and so 
			with my  computer programmming skills, I decided to create a  guessing game in python which was fun and at the sametime helped in their thinking abilities.
